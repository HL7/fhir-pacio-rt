### Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources

Based on the [HL7® FHIR®]({{site.data.fhir.path}}index.html) standard, this IG uses terminology, notations, and design principles that are specific to FHIR®. Therefore, implementers of this specification need to understand some basic information about the FHIR® specification.

Before reading this IG, it’s important to be familiar with some of the basic principles of FHIR®, as well as general guidance on how to read FHIR® specifications. Readers who are unfamiliar with FHIR® may find reading the following information helpful prior to reading the rest of this IG.

* [FHIR overview]({{site.data.fhir.path}}overview.html)
* [Developer's introduction]({{site.data.fhir.path}}overview-dev.html)
* [FHIR data types]({{site.data.fhir.path}}datatypes.html)
* [Using codes]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies.html)
* [References between resources]({{site.data.fhir.path}}references.html)
* [How to read resource & profile definitions]({{site.data.fhir.path}}formats.html)
* [Base resource]({{site.data.fhir.path}}resource.html)
* [Security]({{site.data.fhir.path}}security.html)
* [Security Labels]({{site.data.fhir.path}}security-labels.html)

The Re-assessment Timepoints IG supports the [R4]({{site.data.fhir.path}}index.html) version of the FHIR® standard and builds on the [US Core Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core); therefore, implementers of the Re-assessment Timepoints IG need to familiarize themselves with the Profiles and FHIR® Resources in the US Core IG:
